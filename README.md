# CSS Introduction Lab

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

We've only learned the very basics today with HTML and CSS, so what the hell can we really build, right? Wrong, we can build some cool stuff already, and we're going to do just that.

We all have to eat (I think) so let's make some handy recipe pages for when we do. We're going to be recreating a French Onion Soup recipe, as well as an Apple Pie recipe.

Cloning something that already exists is the best way to get better at frontend development, so check out the deliverable below to see what we're expecting.

There's a bit of starter code, so you can jump right into it.

## Requirements

- [Learn how to fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `code/labs` folder
- Make sure you use `class` and `id` selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify *every* element of that type
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The background with a picture of the apple pie
  - The recipe servings / nutrients section
  - The prep section

## Starter code

You will be working in the `apple-pie-starter-code` folder. The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css`.

## Deliverable

Please find a screenshot of the expected results below:

![French Onion](images/french-onion-soup.jpg)

## Bonus

If you feel you need more practice, in the `starter-code` you will find `extra-french-soup` folder. There you will find `expected-result.md` file where you can see what is expected from you to build. This folder has the same structure as the the `apple-pie` one so follow the same steps.

## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

Then create a Pull Request!!
